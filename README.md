To install these dotfiles and automatically symlink with your home folder, please install [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) and run `bb install.clj <system>`.

### Systems
- `artemis`: macbook
- `turing`: desktop PC

### Editor

Neovim configuration inspired by [cajus-nfnl](https://github.com/rafaeldelboni/cajus-nfnl) with [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/)!

### Shell

I'm using [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as my shell. It's a friendly shell, I feel faster than zsh and easier to customize than bash.

For mac, just add `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"` to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` to load brew packages.
